It’s a small clone of Asteroids with a few extra goodies like power-ups.<br><br><h2>Role:</h2>Solo Developer<br><br><h2>Tools & Technologies Used:</h2>Godot, GDScript, Aseprite<br><br><h2>Development:</h2>This project was made in 4 days. Before making this, I was experiencing what most people call “tutorial hell.” To sum it up, tutorial hell is when you rely solely on video tutorials to explain each step. Thankfully, I overcame this as I learnt how to guide my way through documentation.<br><br><h2>Design:</h2>I tried to keep the design simple for this project—nothing over the top, just like Asteroids. I stuck to a 1-bit colour palette of just black and white. The game is also rendered in a lower resolution, then scaled up to match the window size while keeping the pixel consistency.<br><br><h2>Outcome:</h2>This project taught me not only how to use Godot but also how to read documentation for any product. Thanks to this skill, I’m now able to pick up and learn an application without relying on internet tutorials.<br><br>You can play it online here: voscal.itch.io/asteroids"
