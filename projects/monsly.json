The game takes place inside a terrarium, and your goal is to escape as the plant life inside it continues to rapidly grow until there is no room left.<br><br><h2>Role:</h2>Solo Developer<br><br><h2>Tools & Technologies Used:</h2>Godot, C#, Aseprite<br><br><h2>Development:</h2>The project was made in 5 days for Pirate Softwareâ€™s 14th game jam. My main focus for this game jam was improving my art skills. Due to this focus, the gameplay and audio are somewhat lacking. The game consists of 2 levels: one normal level structured like a small obstacle course, and the other a chase sequence test. In the chase level, you must run away from a wall of rapidly growing moss.<br><br><h2>Design:</h2>I wanted the game to look natural, as it takes place in a terrarium. As mentioned before, my main focus was on improving my art. I started by designing a simple character.<br><br><img src=\"Images\\monsly art preview.png\" class=\"center\"/><p class=\"text-center\">(Screenshot from the game)</p><br><br>When designing the character, I stuck to a dark green color palette with some lighter colors to make it easier to distinguish the character from the background. The character wears a mushroom hat, leaf-like clothes, and carries a trusty sword for combat against any unexpected enemies that may appear along the way.<br><br><h2>Outcome:</h2>This project taught me a lot about how environments and character designs can work together to create an atmosphere for your world. I also learned that when designing assets, it's always good to have references and guidelines to keep your art consistent throughout your project"
