  "content": "“Epik Game Ing” (Epic Gaming) is a game made in 5 minutes for a game jam titled “The Bad Game Jam,” where the goal is to have fun making something. So, I made this “game”—it’s widely compatible with anything that supports JPEG files.<br><br><h2>Role:</h2>Solo Developer<br><br><h2>Tools & Technologies Used:</h2>Paint3D<br><br><h2>Development:</h2>Development was quite simple. First, I had the idea to make a game using something unexpected, like PowerPoint or MS Paint. But then I decided to make a JPEG instead. The game was then professionally handcrafted in 5 minutes, ready to be published to the world!<br><br><h2>Design:</h2>I wanted the game to have a stock photo feel, as they are mostly related to JPEGs and PNGs. So, I found a free royalty-free photo of a businessman. But that wasn’t enough, so I found a photo of stock photo watermarks and pasted that on top, alongside instructions on how to play the game.<br><br><h2>Outcome:</h2>It’s important to have fun while making a game or project. You also don’t need any fancy tools to create something fun.<br><br>You can download the \"game\" here: voscal.itch.io/epik-gameing"
