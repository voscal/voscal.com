  "content": "Babagaboosh GUI is an easy-to-use implementation of DougDoug’s Babagaboosh project, built using Godot Engine 4.2.1 and C#. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for all users.<br><br><h2>Note:</h2> This project is still in active development and may contain bugs. It is a work in progress, and an official release will be made once the application is feature-complete.<br><br><h2>Role:</h2> Solo Developer<br><br><h2>tools & Technologies Used:</h2>Godot, C#, MS Paint, FL Studio, Affinity Designer 2<br><br><h2>Development:</h2>This project has been one of my longest yet; I started it in early February and am still actively working on it. My main goal was to create a tool accessible to everyone.<br><br><h2>Design:</h2>This project’s design is deeply inspired by Super Mario Maker and its user experience. That game makes it fun to do any task, including the tedious parts of making a level. I wanted to bring that feeling into Babagaboosh. I achieved this by turning all the icons into characters, adding small Easter eggs wherever I could, and applying a few design principles like color theory. Fun fact: Yellow is the main color in Super Mario Maker because yellow represents fun and happiness.<br><br><h2>Outcome:</h2>So far, I’ve learned a lot from this project, particularly in working on UI and receiving feedback from users to improve the overall experience.<br><br>You can play the latest build here: https://github.com/voscal/babagaboosh-GUI"
